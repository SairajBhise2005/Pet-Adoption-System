# Pet Adoption System

Welcome to the **Pet Adoption System** project! This is a small yet evolving project developed as part of a university course on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. The goal of this project is to create a system that facilitates pet adoption while applying core OOP concepts such as objects, encapsulation, security, and the software development life cycle.

As I continue to learn and grow, this project will be updated with new features, improvements, and refinements. I welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from the community to help make this project better.

## Project Overview

The **Pet Adoption System** is designed to:
- Manage pet adoption processes efficiently.
- Provide a platform for users to browse, adopt, and manage pets.
- Demonstrate the application of OOP principles in a real-world scenario.

This project is a work in progress, and new features will be added incrementally as I progress through the course.

## Features

### Current Features
- **Pet Management**: Add, update, and remove pets from the system.
- **User Management**: Register and manage users (adopters).
- **Adoption Process**: Facilitate the adoption of pets by users.
- **Basic Security**: Encapsulation and data protection mechanisms.

### Planned Features
- **Search and Filter**: Allow users to search for pets based on criteria like breed, age, or size.
- **Admin Panel**: Provide an interface for administrators to manage pets and users.
- **Data Persistence**: Save and load data using files or a database.
- **Enhanced Security**: Implement user authentication and authorization.
- **Notifications**: Notify users about adoption status updates.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java (or another OOP language, depending on your choice).
- **Concepts**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, etc.
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
